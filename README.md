# hun-phone-validator
Validator for hungarian mobile phone numbers!

This small code can validate Hungarian mobile phone numbers.

It checks whether the phone number is real and whether it was issued by a Hungarian mobile service provider (according to NMHH http://agapub.nmhh.hu/aga_web/szolgaltatoBeforeAction?request_locale=hu)
If phone number is real, then the return is the phone number itself, 
if it is not real, then the return value is false.
